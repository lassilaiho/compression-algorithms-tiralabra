# Comparison of compression algorithms

This is a project for the course "Aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂: tietorakenteet ja
algoritmit" at the University of Helsinki.

## Building the project

The compression programs can be built by running `make all` at the root of the
repository.

`make lint` runs `go vet` and `golint` on the project (requires golint to be
installed and found in the path).

`make test` executes unit tests and writes a test coverage report to
`cover.out`. The report can be viewed by running
```
go tool cover -html=cover.out
```

An online test coverage report can be found [here](https://codecov.io/gh/lassilaiho/compression-algorithms-tiralabra).
