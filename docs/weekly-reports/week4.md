# Weekly report 4

This week I improved the LZ77 encoding implementation, both speed and
compression ratio. I also refactored the project and wrote some documentation. I
worked on the project for about 18 hours this week.

## Questions

The Makefile uses bash features that might not work on Windows. Is that a
problem?

## Next week

Next week I'll reimplement all remaining standard library and built-in functions
and data structures. I'll also begin to compare the algorithms.
