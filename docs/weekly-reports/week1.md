# Weekly report 1

This week was mostly about reading about Huffman coding and LZ77 and writing the
design document. I also thought about the design a bit. In total I worked on the
project about 5 hours this week.

## Next week

I will start implementing Huffman code and LZ77 compression and decompression
using standard library data structures which I will later on replace with my own
implementations.
