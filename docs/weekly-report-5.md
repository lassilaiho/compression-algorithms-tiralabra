# Weekly report 5

This week I replaced the rest of the standard library and built-in functions and
data structures with my own implementations. I also added more test files for
use in performance testing and comparison and wrote a program to measure
performance and output the results in CSV format. I worked on the project for
about 8.5 hours this week.

## Next week

Next week I'll continue algorithm comparisons and finish writing the testing
document. I may also refactor parts of the project and write other missing
documentation.
